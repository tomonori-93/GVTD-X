# About this directory
There are sample programs with real data from single-Doppler radar observations. 

# Program list 
* [`GVTDX_Dradar`](docs/GVTDX_Dradar.md)
  * To retrieve TC circulations from single-Doppler radar observations by using GVTD-X (or GBVTD/GVTD). 
* [`GVTDX_budgets`](docs/GVTDX_budgets.md)
  * To calculate budget equations of angular momentum, vorticity, and enstrophy with output by `GVTDX_Dradar`. 

# Compiling
By running `make`, the programs will be compilied.
