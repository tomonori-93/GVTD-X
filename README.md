<!--# ToRMHOWe (ともえ)
ToRMHOWe (Tropical-cyclone circulation Retrieval Method based on the Helmholtz decomposition from Observation of single-Doppler Weather radars) is a Fortran library to retrieve tangential and radial wind components in atmospheric vortices from single-Doppler radar observations. 

ToRMHOWe is pronounced as "To-Moe" and written as 鞆絵 or 巴 in Chinese characters, which is come from a Japanese traditional pattern.
